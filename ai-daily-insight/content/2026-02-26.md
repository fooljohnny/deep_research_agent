## Executive Summary

This is a **sample post** generated as a placeholder during project initialisation.
Once the pipeline runs with a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`, this file will be replaced
by a fully automated daily insight post covering the latest developments in
artificial intelligence.

## How It Works

1. **Fetch** — RSS feeds from leading AI sources (MIT Tech Review, OpenAI Blog,
   Google AI, Hugging Face, arXiv, and more) are polled for new articles.
2. **Analyse (Stage-1 Prompt)** — An LLM receives the raw article list and
   extracts themes, significance ratings, and an executive summary as structured
   JSON.
3. **Generate (Stage-2 Prompt)** — A second LLM call transforms the structured
   analysis into this polished Markdown blog post.

## Notable Reads

- *No articles fetched yet — this is a placeholder.*

## Looking Ahead

Configure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret in your repository settings, then trigger
the workflow manually or wait for the daily 06:00 UTC schedule.
